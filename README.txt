This is a prototype for an Air Hockey/Carrom game.
main.cpp has a function to predict where the puck will be and tries to shoot the mallet towards the puck.
This function can be refined and used to make a carrom/ Air Hockey AI.
'Air Hockey' folder consists of a simulator Unity2d project which was used to simulate if the numbers given by main.cpp actually work or not.

This prototype was made for a contest held locally at National Institute of Technology Silchar, Assam.
